## Hi <Twemoji emoji="waving hand" /> I'm Sheharyar Khan

I'm an 18-year-old Full-Stack Web Developer <Twemoji emoji="laptop" /> based in Karachi, Pakistan. I specialize in building modern, responsive websites using technologies like Next.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and Supabase. I enjoy creating smooth user experiences with solid backend functionality.

Alongside web development, I'm also learning Agentic AI and sharpening my skills in Python. Whether it's working on frontend design, backend systems, or integrating AI features â€” I'm always excited to learn and build.

In my free time, I vibe to good music <Twemoji emoji="headphones" /> and catch inspiring movies <Twemoji emoji="movie" /> â€” they keep my creativity flowing and help me think differently.

ðŸ§  I'm passionate about tech, always exploring new tools, and leveling up one project at a time.

Letâ€™s build something awesome together <Twemoji emoji="rocket" />
